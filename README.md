​In 2017 Google gave away the Transformer architecture & without anyone knowing it, changed the world forever. The Transformer architecture was the key breakthrough that allowed for the Large Language Models (ChatGPT) that we all know & love today.

Less known however in that same year Google Deepmind did it again, releasing AlphaZero to the world.
​Whilst Chatgpt seems like the star, it can only ever approach the limit that is human intelligence.
​AlphaZero is the first truly general-purpose algorithm to achieve superhuman results across multiple domains.

To take AI to the next level, smarter than humans, techniques from AlphaZero are already being applied to Large Language Models.

​In this 4-week workshop, hosted at Block's Sydney offices, we are going to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to build the AlphaZero algorithm and apply it to a target domain of their choosing. By incorporating Blockʼs Goose, the workshop offers a unique, interactive learning experience. Goose will serve as a real-time tutor, guiding participants through the syllabus, providing personalised assistance, and managing study schedules.

​Participants can expect to learn a deep understanding of AlphaZero’s core components:

​Reinforcement learning (RL)\
​Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\
​Neural Networks
***

​The Syllabus will cover the following topics:

​RL and Self-Play Basics\
​Mastering MCTS\
​Neural Network Design\
​Data and Self-Play\
​AlphaZero Training Workflow\
​AlphaZero Evaluation Techniques\
​Customising AlphaZero for a new domain\
​AlphaZero Optimisation Strategies\

​To wrap it up participants will get to adapt AlphaZero to a specific domain.
