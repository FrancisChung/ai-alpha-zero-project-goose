# Act I - Core Concepts ðŸ“š

Welcome to your first lesson on **RL Fundamentals**, Francis! Let's start with the foundation of all reinforcement learning.

## The Agent-Environment Loop

The single most important idea in Reinforcement Learning is the **Agent-Environment Loop**. An **agent** (our AI) exists within an **environment** (the game). The agent performs an **action**, which changes the environment's **state** and provides a **reward**. This loop of observing, acting, and learning continues until the game ends.

This fundamental concept is at the heart of everything we'll be learning about AlphaZero and reinforcement learning. The beauty of this loop is its simplicity - yet it's powerful enough to solve complex problems like mastering chess, Go, and many other challenging domains.
