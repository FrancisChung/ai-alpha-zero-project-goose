Great question, Francis! The **agent** is essentially the "brain" or decision-maker in the reinforcement learning system. Let me break down its key roles:

## The Agent's Primary Roles:

**1. Observer** 👁️
- The agent constantly observes the current state of the environment
- It processes this information to understand "what's happening right now"

**2. Decision-Maker** 🧠
- Based on what it observes, the agent chooses which action to take
- This is where the "intelligence" happens - learning which actions work best

**3. Learner** 📚
- The agent remembers what happened when it took certain actions
- It learns from rewards (good outcomes) and penalties (bad outcomes)
- Over time, it gets better at choosing actions that lead to higher rewards

**4. Goal-Seeker** 🎯
- The agent's ultimate goal is to maximize its total reward over time
- It's constantly trying to figure out the best strategy to achieve this

## Think of it like this:
If you're playing chess, **you** are the agent:
- You observe the board state
- You decide which piece to move
- You learn from wins/losses
- Your goal is to win the game

In AlphaZero, the AI takes on this same role - it observes the board, decides on moves, learns from outcomes, and aims to win.

Does this help clarify the agent's role? Any follow-up questions about how the agent interacts with the environment?
