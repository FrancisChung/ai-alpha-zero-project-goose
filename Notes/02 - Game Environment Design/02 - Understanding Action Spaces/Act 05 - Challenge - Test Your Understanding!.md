# Act V: Challenge - Test Your Understanding! ðŸŽ¯

Time for your next checkpoint! Let's test your understanding of action spaces.

## Quiz Question:

**The 'Action Space' is a set of...**

**A)** All possible states in the environment.  
**B)** All past rewards the agent has received.  
**C)** All valid actions the agent can take from the current state.

Please submit your answer (A, B, or C)!

Answer C

ðŸŽ‰ **Excellent!** Perfect answer! 

You've successfully completed another lesson in Game Environment Design and earned **8 more XP** (total: 41 XP)! You now understand how to define and implement action spaces for RL environments.

## Lesson Complete! âœ…
- âœ… **Act I** - Learned what action spaces are and why they matter
- âœ… **Act II** - Watched action space implementation video  
- âœ… **Act III** - Saw dynamic action space code in practice
- âœ… **Act IV** - Discussed critical importance for planning agents like AlphaZero
- âœ… **Act V** - Passed the challenge

## Key Takeaway:
Action spaces define **all valid actions the agent can take from the current state** - and proper design is crucial for efficient learning and planning!

Outstanding progress, francis from team "goose on the loose"! You're building practical environment design skills that directly connect to how systems like AlphaZero work. You now understand:

1. âœ… Why we use Python classes for environments
2. âœ… How to implement dynamic action spaces
