# Act IV: Q&A - The Critical Importance of Accurate Transitions ðŸ¤”

Why might it be dangerous for an agent to rely on a transition function that's incomplete or inaccurate? How would that affect its ability to plan?

This is a crucial question that connects back to your understanding of model-based RL and planning agents like AlphaZero!

## The Planning Connection:

Remember: **Model-based agents like AlphaZero use the transition function to simulate future moves during MCTS planning.**

### What Could Go Wrong with Inaccurate Transitions:

**ðŸš« Incomplete Transition Function:**
- Agent plans based on partial game rules
- Missing edge cases lead to unexpected crashes
- Example: Forgetting to handle "column full" situations

**ðŸŽ¯ Inaccurate Transition Function:**
- Agent makes plans based on wrong physics
- Strategies developed don't work in real environment
- Example: Wrong gravity behavior â†’ pieces float in mid-air!

**ðŸ“‰ Planning Quality Impact:**
- **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: Bad transition â†’ Bad plans
- **Wasted Computation**: MCTS explores impossible game states
- **Poor Performance**: Agent optimizes for wrong environment

## Real AlphaZero Example:
If AlphaZero's chess transition function incorrectly allowed pawns to move backwards, it would develop completely invalid strategies that fail in real chess!

## The Key Insight:
**The transition function IS the environment's truth.** If it's wrong, the agent learns to be excellent at playing the wrong game.

This is why rigorous testing of transition functions is critical in RL development!

Do you see how this connects to the model-based concepts you learned earlier?
