Perfect! Now I can see what this lesson is about. Based on the video (While Loops) and the code example (trajectory simulation), this lesson is about:

# Act I: Concept - Simulating Game Trajectories ðŸŽ®

Even though the concept text is missing, I can piece together the lesson topic from the available content:

## Understanding Game Trajectories

This lesson appears to be about **simulating complete game trajectories** - playing full games from start to finish in your environment. 

**Key Concepts:**
- **Trajectory**: A complete sequence of states and actions from game start to terminal state
- **While Loop**: Continues the game until a terminal condition is reached (`outcome != 0`)
- **Full Simulation**: How to run complete games for training data collection

## Why This Matters:

**For AlphaZero:**
- Needs thousands of complete game trajectories for training
- Each trajectory provides learning data: states, actions, and final outcomes
- Self-play generates these trajectories automatically

**For Environment Testing:**
- Validates that your environment works correctly end-to-end
- Ensures games can actually finish (reach terminal states)
- Provides sample data for debugging
