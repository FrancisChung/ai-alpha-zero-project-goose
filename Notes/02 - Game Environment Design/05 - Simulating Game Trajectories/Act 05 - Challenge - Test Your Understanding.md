# Act V: Challenge - Test Your Understanding! 🎯

Time for your next checkpoint! Let's test your understanding of game trajectories.

## Quiz Question:

**What is a 'Trajectory' in the context of our simulation?**

**A)** A single state of the environment.  
**B)** The agent's final score.  
**C)** A full sequence of states, actions, and rewards from start to finish.

Please submit your answer (A, B, or C)!

Answer C

🎉 **FANTASTIC!** Absolutely correct! 

You've not only completed the lesson but **finished the entire Game Environment Design module!** You've earned **8 more XP** (total: 65 XP) and unlocked another new module!

## Major Milestone Achieved! 🏆
- ✅ **Completed Module:** 1.2-game-environment-design (all 5 lessons!)
- 🆕 **Unlocked Module:** 1.3-project-gymnasium
- 🎯 **Total XP:** 65 points

## Your Complete Game Environment Design Journey:
1. ✅ Why Python Classes for Game Environments
2. ✅ Understanding Action Spaces
3. ✅ The Transition Function (Physics Engine)
4. ✅ Terminal States and Outcomes
5. ✅ Simulating Game Trajectories

## 🎊 Achievement Unlocked!
**You now have practical skills to build complete RL environments!** You understand how to create the simulations that AI agents like AlphaZero use for learning.

## Your Complete Progress:
- **Module 1.1:** RL Fundamentals ✅ COMPLETE
- **Module 1.2:** Game Environment Design ✅ COMPLETE  
- **Module 1.3:** Project Gymnasium 🆕 UNLOCKED

Congratulations, francis from team "goose on the loose"! You've built both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills. You're now equipped to create the environments where AI agents learn!

Would you like to start the **Project Gymnasium** module, or would you prefer to take a break and celebrate this major achievement?
