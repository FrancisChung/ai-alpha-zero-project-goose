Perfect! Let's continue with the trajectory simulation example. Since we've already loaded Act III, let me show you the code:

# Act III: Example - Simulating Complete Game Trajectories 💻

Here's the practical example showing how to simulate full game trajectories:

```python
# Simulate a full trajectory through the environment
import random

def simulate_trajectory(env):
    trajectory = []
    outcome = 0

    while outcome == 0:
        # In practice, the agent would choose an action based on a policy
        # Here, we choose randomly from valid options
        action = random.choice(env.get_action_space())

        # Capture the state before the action
        state_snapshot = env.state.copy()
        
        # Apply the action and transition to a new state
        env.transition(action)

        # Get the outcome (0 if still running, +1 or -1 if terminal)
        outcome = env.get_outcome()

        # Record this step in the trajectory
        trajectory.append({'state': state_snapshot, 'action': action})

    print(f"Trajectory complete: {len(trajectory)} steps. Final outcome: {outcome}")
    return trajectory
```

This trajectory simulation demonstrates key concepts:

**Complete Game Loop:**
- 🔄 **While Loop**: `while outcome == 0` continues until game ends
- 📸 **State Capture**: Records state before each move
- 🎯 **Action Selection**: Chooses from valid actions (randomly here)
- 🔄 **State Transition**: Applies the move to update the environment
- 🏁 **Terminal Check**: Checks if game ended after each move

**Data Collection:**
- Each step records: `{'state': board_before_move, 'action': chosen_move}`
- Final outcome provides learning signal for entire trajectory
- This is exactly the training data AlphaZero needs!

**Real-World Usage:**
- Replace `random.choice()` with agent's policy for actual training
- Run thousands of these trajectories to collect training data
- Each trajectory teaches the agent about complete game sequences

Would you like to "run" this code to see a complete game simulation?
