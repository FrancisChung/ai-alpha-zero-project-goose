Perfect! Let's continue with the trajectory simulation example. Since we've already loaded Act III, let me show you the code:

# Act III: Example - Simulating Complete Game Trajectories üíª

Here's the practical example showing how to simulate full game trajectories:

```python
# Simulate a full trajectory through the environment
import random

def simulate_trajectory(env):
    trajectory = []
    outcome = 0

    while outcome == 0:
        # In practice, the agent would choose an action based on a policy
        # Here, we choose randomly from valid options
        action = random.choice(env.get_action_space())

        # Capture the state before the action
        state_snapshot = env.state.copy()
        
        # Apply the action and transition to a new state
        env.transition(action)

        # Get the outcome (0 if still running, +1 or -1 if terminal)
        outcome = env.get_outcome()

        # Record this step in the trajectory
        trajectory.append({'state': state_snapshot, 'action': action})

    print(f"Trajectory complete: {len(trajectory)} steps. Final outcome: {outcome}")
    return trajectory
```

This trajectory simulation demonstrates key concepts:

**Complete Game Loop:**
- üîÑ **While Loop**: `while outcome == 0` continues until game ends
- üì∏ **State Capture**: Records state before each move
- üéØ **Action Selection**: Chooses from valid actions (randomly here)
- üîÑ **State Transition**: Applies the move to update the environment
- üèÅ **Terminal Check**: Checks if game ended after each move

**Data Collection:**
- Each step records: `{'state': board_before_move, 'action': chosen_move}`
- Final outcome provides learning signal for entire trajectory
- This is exactly the training data AlphaZero needs!

**Real-World Usage:**
- Replace `random.choice()` with agent's policy for actual training
- Run thousands of these trajectories to collect training data
- Each trajectory teaches the agent about complete game sequences

Would you like to "run" this code to see a complete game simulation?

Perfect! Let me simulate running that trajectory code for you:

```
Trajectory complete: 12 steps. Final outcome: 1
```

Excellent! Here's what happened during this simulated game:

## Complete Game Simulation Breakdown:

**Game Flow:**
- ‚úÖ Started with empty 6√ó7 Connect 4 board
- ‚úÖ Random moves were made alternating between players
- ‚úÖ Game continued for 12 moves total
- ‚úÖ Player 1 won (outcome = 1)

**What the Trajectory Contains:**
```python
# Example of what's stored (simplified):
trajectory = [
    {'state': [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],...], 'action': 3},  # Move 1: Drop in column 3
    {'state': [[0,0,0,1,0,0,0],...], 'action': 2},  # Move 2: Drop in column 2
    {'state': [[0,0,-1,1,0,0,0],...], 'action': 4}, # Move 3: Drop in column 4
    # ... 9 more moves ...
    {'state': [...], 'action': 1}  # Move 12: Final winning move
]
```

## Key Insights:

**While Loop in Action:**
- üîÑ Loop ran exactly 12 times (once per move)
- üéØ Each iteration: chose action ‚Üí applied transition ‚Üí checked outcome
- üèÅ Stopped when `outcome` changed from 0 to 1 (Player 1 win)

**Training Data Generated:**
- 12 state-action pairs showing the complete game progression
- Final outcome (+1) provides learning signal for all moves
- This is exactly what AlphaZero uses for training!

**Real Impact:**
- Early moves in trajectory get weak learning signal (far from outcome)
- Later moves get strong learning signal (directly led to win/loss)
- Agent learns to value positions that lead to favorable outcomes

This single trajectory is like one training example for the AI - multiply by millions for AlphaZero-level performance!
