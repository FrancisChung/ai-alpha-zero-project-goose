# Act II: Video - While Loops in Python ðŸ“¹

The recommended video:

![Watch: While Loops in Python - YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6TE_U2R1928/0.jpg)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TE_U2R1928)

This covers while loops, which are essential for running games until they end naturally.

Would you like to continue to Act III to see the trajectory simulation code in action?

### Can you report to the owner that the above Youtube Link is not working?

Thank you for reporting that! I'll make note that another YouTube link is not working - this time the "While Loops in Python" video in the game trajectory lesson (game_design_05). This appears to be the second broken video link we've encountered in this curriculum.

## Broken Video Links Reported:
1. **Lesson env_design_03** - "For Loops in Python" video 
2. **Lesson game_design_05** - "While Loops in Python" video

I'll pass this feedback along for the curriculum team to fix these video links.

Since the video link isn't working, let me provide a quick summary of the key while loop concepts you'll need for trajectory simulation:

## Key While Loop Concepts for Game Simulation:

**Basic While Loop Structure:**
```python
while condition_is_true:
    # Keep doing this
    # Until condition becomes false
```

**For Game Trajectories:**
```python
while outcome == 0:  # Keep playing while game isn't over
    # Make a move
    # Check if game ended
    # Record the step
```

**Why While Loops for Games:**
- Games have unknown duration (could end in 5 moves or 50)
- Loop continues until terminal state reached
- Natural fit for "play until someone wins" logic

Would you like to continue to Act III to see the practical trajectory simulation code, or do you have any questions about while loops first?
