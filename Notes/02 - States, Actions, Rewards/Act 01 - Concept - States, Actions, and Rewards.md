# Act I: Concept - States, Actions, and Rewards ðŸŽ¯

Great! Now that you understand the Agent-Environment Loop, let's dive deeper into its core components.

## The Building Blocks of Reinforcement Learning

Now that we've introduced the Agent-Environment Loop, let's take a closer look at its building blocks:

- A **State** is a snapshot of everything the agent needs to know about the environment at a given momentâ€”for example, the positions of all chess pieces on the board.  
- An **Action** is a decision the agent makes that affects the stateâ€”like moving a pawn forward.  
- A **Reward** is feedback from the environment that tells the agent how good or bad that action was (e.g., +1 for winning, -1 for losing, 0 for a neutral move).

> The agent's ultimate goal? Learn which actions lead to the most reward over timeâ€”not just immediately, but in the long run.

This lesson will help you understand how these three elements work together to enable learning. The Game Environment Design concepts will come later in the curriculum once you've mastered these fundamentals!
