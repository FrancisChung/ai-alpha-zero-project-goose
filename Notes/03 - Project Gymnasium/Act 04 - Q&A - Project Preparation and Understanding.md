# Act IV: Q&A - Project Preparation and Understanding ðŸ¤”

This is your first major project - you're taking everything you've learned about environments and making it industry-ready. The template above shows the structure you need to implement. Do you have any questions about the Gymnasium API before you begin coding?

Let me help clarify the key concepts and requirements:

## Gymnasium API Requirements:

### **The `step()` Method Must Return 5 Values:**
```python
def step(self, action):
    # Your transition logic here
    return observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info
```
- **observation**: Current state (your board)
- **reward**: Immediate reward for this step  
- **terminated**: Boolean - did the game end naturally? (win/loss/draw)
- **truncated**: Boolean - did we cut the game short? (usually False)
- **info**: Dictionary with extra information (can be empty {})

### **The `reset()` Method Must Return 2 Values:**
```python
def reset(self, seed=None, options=None):
    # Reset your game state
    return observation, info
```

### **Action and Observation Spaces:**
- **Action Space**: `spaces.Discrete(7)` = actions 0-6 (7 columns)
- **Observation Space**: `spaces.Box(low=-1, high=1, shape=(6,7))` = 6Ã—7 board with values -1 to 1

## Questions to Consider:
- How will you map your current transition function to the `step()` method?
- What reward structure will you use? (+1/0/-1 for win/draw/loss?)
- How will you detect when `terminated=True`?

Do you have any specific questions about implementing these requirements, or are you ready to start the project challenge?
