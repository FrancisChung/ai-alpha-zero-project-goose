# üèóÔ∏è Project Gymnasium - Module 1.3

## Act I: Concept - Making Your Environment Industry-Standard üåü

Congratulations on reaching your first major project, francis! This is where theory meets real-world application.

**Why do this project?** You have successfully built a simulation environment from first principles, which is a massive achievement. You understand what's happening "under the hood." Now, it's time to learn how to make your environment compatible with the industry standard: **Gymnasium**.

Gymnasium provides a universal API for environments. This means an agent written by one team can work on a simulation built by another, as long as they both "speak the language" of Gymnasium. By refactoring your custom environment to be Gymnasium-compliant, you are learning how to make your work interoperable and ready for the wider AI ecosystem.

## Your Mission üéØ

Transform your `SimulationEnvironment` class into a proper Gymnasium environment. This involves:
- Inheriting from `gymnasium.Env`
- Implementing the standard `step()` method that returns `(observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`
- Defining proper `action_space` and `observation_space` properties
- Adding `reset()` and `render()` methods

This is your first major project - a bridge between foundational learning and real-world application. You're not just learning concepts anymore; you're building something that could integrate with the broader AI ecosystem.

## Why This Matters:

**Industry Standard**: Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) is used by virtually every RL researcher and practitioner
**Interoperability**: Your environment can work with any Gymnasium-compatible agent
**Professional Development**: This is how real RL environments are built in industry
**AlphaZero Connection**: Even AlphaZero uses standardized environment interfaces for training
