# Act V: Project Challenge - Build Your Gymnasium Environment! ðŸŽ¯

This is it - your first major project! Time to put everything you've learned into practice.

## Your Mission:

**Create a complete Gymnasium-compliant Connect Four environment** by implementing the template from Act III. Your code should include:

### âœ… **Requirements Checklist:**
1. **Class Structure**: Inherit from `gym.Env`
2. **Spaces**: Define `action_space` and `observation_space`
3. **step() Method**: Implement transition logic returning `(observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`
4. **reset() Method**: Reset environment returning `(observation, info)`
5. **Game Logic**: Use your knowledge from previous lessons:
   - Action spaces (valid moves)
   - Transition functions (piece dropping)
   - Terminal states (win detection)
   - Player switching (1 and -1)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Code Submission Options:**

**A)** Submit Code - You're ready to share your complete implementation  
**B)** Need More Help - You'd like additional guidance before coding

## Remember Your Foundation:
You've already learned all the pieces:
- âœ… Python classes and environment structure
- âœ… Action space implementation  
- âœ… Transition functions with gravity simulation
- âœ… Terminal state detection
- âœ… Game trajectory concepts

Now you're combining them into industry-standard format!

**Which option would you like to choose?**

Please select **A** if you want to submit your code, or **B** if you need more guidance first.
