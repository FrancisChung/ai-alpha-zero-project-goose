Great question! Transition functions are a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, especially important for understanding model-based RL (which is actually what you're learning about in your current lesson!).

## What is a Transition Function?

A **transition function** defines how the environment changes from one state to another when an agent takes an action. It's essentially the "rules" of the environment.

**Formal definition:** T(s, a, s') = probability of moving from state s to state s' when taking action a

## Key Characteristics:

- **Deterministic**: Always the same outcome (chess, tic-tac-toe)
- **Stochastic**: Random outcomes with probabilities (dice games, real-world scenarios)

## Examples:

### 1. **Chess (Deterministic)**
```
State s: Knight at B1
Action a: Move knight to C3
Next state s': Knight at C3
Transition: T(knight_at_B1, move_to_C3, knight_at_C3) = 1.0 (100% certain)
```

### 2. **Coin Flip Game (Stochastic)**
```
State s: 0 points
Action a: Bet on heads
Possible outcomes:
- T(0_points, bet_heads, +1_point) = 0.5 (50% chance win)
- T(0_points, bet_heads, -1_point) = 0.5 (50% chance lose)
```

### 3. **Grid World Navigation**
```
State s: Robot at position (2,3)
Action a: Move right
Next state s': Robot at position (3,3)
Transition: T((2,3), move_right, (3,3)) = 1.0
```

### 4. **Real-World Driving (Stochastic)**
```
State s: Car approaching intersection
Action a: Accelerate through yellow light
Possible outcomes:
- T(yellow_light, accelerate, through_safely) = 0.8
- T(yellow_light, accelerate, get_ticket) = 0.15
- T(yellow_light, accelerate, accident) = 0.05
```

## Connection to Your Current Lesson:

This directly relates to **Model-Based vs Model-Free RL**:

- **Model-Based agents** explicitly learn or know the transition function T(s,a,s')
- **Model-Free agents** don't try to learn the transition function - they just learn what actions work through experience

**AlphaZero** (model-based) knows the game rules (transition function) and can simulate "what if I move here?" That's why it can plan ahead using Monte Carlo Tree Search!

This is a perfect example of why understanding these fundamentals helps you grasp the more advanced concepts. Great question!
