## Act I: Concept - Why Python Classes for Game Environments? 🏗️

Congratulations on unlocking this module, francis! Now let's dive into the practical side of creating environments where AI agents can learn.

**Why Do We Use Python Classes for Game Environments?**

Before we write any code, let us step back and ask: **What are we actually building here?**

We are creating a **simulation** — a digital version of a game or **a process** where an AI can learn by interacting with it over and over again. That means we need:

- A way to represent the **state** of the game (like a board or grid)
- A set of **rules** that define how the environment responds to actions
- A way to **start fresh**, so the AI can play thousands of games under consistent conditions

All of this needs to be **organised, repeatable, and isolated** — especially if we want to train agents at scale.

That is why we use a **Python class**

A class lets us wrap the environment's *state*, *rules*, and *reset logic* into a clean, self-contained blueprint. It becomes a plug-and-play interface that the AI agent can use to interact with its world — safely, consistently, and at scale.

## Key Insight:
Think of a Python class as creating a "game factory" - each time you create an instance, you get a fresh, independent game that follows the same rules but can have different outcomes.

This is the foundation that enables AI agents like AlphaZero to play millions of games and learn from each one!
