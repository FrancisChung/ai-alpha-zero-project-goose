# Act IV: Q&A - Clarifying Policies and Value Functions ðŸ¤”

We've introduced two new key terms: 'Policy' and 'Value Function'. Do you have any questions about what they represent?

Let me make sure these concepts are crystal clear:

- **Policy** = The agent's decision-making strategy ("what should I do in this situation?")
- **Value Function** = The agent's evaluation system ("how good is this situation for me?")

These work together like a chess master who both:
1. Has strategies for different positions (policy)
2. Can evaluate how promising each position looks (value function)

The beautiful thing is that as the agent learns, both the policy and value function improve together - leading to smarter decisions and better position evaluation.

Do you have any questions about these concepts, or are you ready to move to the final challenge? any questions about these concepts, or are you ready to move to the final challenge?
