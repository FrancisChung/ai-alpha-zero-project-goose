# Act IV: Q&A - Clarifying the Building Blocks ðŸ¤”

Does the distinction between a 'State', an 'Action', and a 'Reward' make sense? Any questions about those specific terms?

These three concepts are fundamental to everything in reinforcement learning:

- **State** = What the agent sees/knows about the current situation
- **Action** = What the agent chooses to do
- **Reward** = The feedback the agent gets for that choice

Understanding the clear separation between these three elements is crucial because they each play different roles in how an agent learns to make better decisions over time.

Do you have any questions about these concepts, or are you ready to move to the final challenge?
