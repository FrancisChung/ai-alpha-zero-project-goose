# Act III: Example - Model-Based vs Model-Free in Practice ðŸ’»

Here's a practical example showing the key difference between these two approaches:

```python
# Model-Based agent: has an internal rulebook
model = {
    'State_A': {
        'action_1': 'State_B'
    }
}
print(f"[Model-Based] I know that taking 'action_1' from 'State_A' leads to 'State_B': {model['State_A']['action_1']}")

# Model-Free agent: learns only through experience
print("[Model-Free] I don't know what happens if I try 'action_1' from 'State_A'... I'll just try it and find out.")
```

This illustrates the fundamental difference:

**Model-Based Agent:**
- Has an internal "rulebook" (the model dictionary)
- Can predict outcomes before acting
- Can plan multiple steps ahead
- Like AlphaZero knowing chess rules

**Model-Free Agent:**
- No internal model of how the world works
- Learns purely through trial and error
- Develops intuitive patterns over time
- Like learning to ride a bike through practice

Your transition function question earlier was perfect - that's exactly what the model-based agent's "rulebook" contains!

Would you like to "run" this code to see how each agent approaches decision-making?

Perfect! Let me simulate running that code for you:

```
[Model-Based] I know that taking 'action_1' from 'State_A' leads to 'State_B': State_B
[Model-Free] I don't know what happens if I try 'action_1' from 'State_A'... I'll just try it and find out.
```

Excellent! This output perfectly illustrates the fundamental difference:

## Key Insights from the Output:

**Model-Based Agent:**
- âœ… **Predictive**: "I know that taking 'action_1' from 'State_A' leads to 'State_B'"
- âœ… **Confident**: Can state the outcome before acting
- âœ… **Planning Capable**: Could chain multiple predictions together

**Model-Free Agent:**
- ðŸ¤” **Uncertain**: "I don't know what happens if I try..."
- ðŸŽ¯ **Experience-Driven**: "I'll just try it and find out"
- ðŸ’ª **Learning-Focused**: Builds knowledge through doing, not predicting

## Real-World Analogy:
- **Model-Based** = Chess grandmaster who can visualize 10 moves ahead
- **Model-Free** = Athlete who "just knows" the right move from years of practice

Both approaches can be incredibly effective! Model-free agents often develop amazing intuitive skills, while model-based agents excel at strategic planning.

**AlphaZero's Power:** It combines both - it has the game rules (model-based) AND learns incredible patterns through self-play (model-free learning elements).
