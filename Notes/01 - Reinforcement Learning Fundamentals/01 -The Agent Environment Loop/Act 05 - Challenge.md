# Act V - Challenge üèÜ

Excellent work through the lesson, Francis! Now let's test your understanding with a checkpoint challenge.

## Checkpoint Question:

**What is the fundamental cycle in Reinforcement Learning called?**

**A)** The State-Value Loop  
**B)** The Agent-Environment Loop  
**C)** The Action-Reward Cycle  

Take your time to think about what we've learned. Which term best describes the core concept we've been exploring throughout this lesson?

What's your answer? B

# üéâ Excellent Work, Francis!

**Correct!** You nailed it! **The Agent-Environment Loop** is indeed the fundamental cycle in Reinforcement Learning.

## Congratulations! üèÜ

You've successfully completed your first RL Fundamentals lesson and earned **5 XP**! You now have a solid understanding of:

- The core Agent-Environment Loop concept
- How agents observe, act, and learn from their environment
- The role of states, actions, and rewards
- How stochastic environments create challenges
- Different reward function types and their trade-offs
- Real-world applications of these concepts

## What's Next?

Your progress has automatically unlocked the next lesson in your AlphaZero Development journey! You're well on your way to understanding the sophisticated algorithms that power game-playing AIs like AlphaZero.

When you're ready to continue your learning adventure, just let me know! We have more exciting concepts ahead, including:
- Value functions and how agents evaluate positions
- Policy improvement and strategy optimization  
- Monte Carlo methods and tree search
- And eventually, the full AlphaZero algorithm itself!

Great work on mastering these fundamentals, Francis from team "Goose on the loose"! üöÄ
