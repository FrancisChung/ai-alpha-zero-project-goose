# Act IV - Q&A ðŸ¤”

Great work so far, Francis! Let's make sure you have a solid foundation before we move forward.

Before we move on, was there any part of that core conceptâ€”like 'agent' or 'environment'â€”that felt unclear? This is the perfect time to ask.

Feel free to ask about:
- The role of the **agent** vs. the **environment**
- How **actions** lead to **state changes**
- The purpose of **rewards** in the loop
- How this applies to real-world AI systems
- Anything else about the Agent-Environment Loop

What questions do you have, or what would you like me to clarify further?
